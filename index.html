            <h3>What is this game?</h3>
            <p>Silksong is a metroidvania developed by an austrian team of 3 called
            Team Cherry. You play as hornet who has been taken from her own land to
            the kingdom of Pharloom, a land haunted by silk and song. Her goal is
            to find out why she was brought to Pharloom by ascending to the shining
            citadel at the kingdoms peak.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do i like it so much?</h3>
            <p>I love this game because of how openly it is designed. In silksong
            by paying attention to your surrondings and understanding your own
            skillset you can completely break the "intended order" of progression.
            also i really enjoy the lore of Pharloom and how you will slowly come
            to learn about how Pharloom began to decline after uprisings and
            betrayals.
