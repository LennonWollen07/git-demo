        <h3>What is Silksong</h3>
        <p>Silksong is a metroidvania developed by team cherry and released september 4th 2025.
        You play as hornet, who has been taken from her own land to the kingdom of Pharloom; A
        kingdom haunted by silk and song. She takes it upon herself to find out why she was 
        brought there by ascending to the shining citadel at the kingdom's peak.</p>

        <h3>Why is it here?</h3>
        <p>Silksong is here because it is a challenging and incredibly rewarding game to play.
        Hornet has access to a variety of diffrent movement abilities that allow you to speedily
        strike down foes while exploring the variety of enviroments within Pharloom. I also really like
        the progression of this game with how many ways there are to reach key objectives or
        completely skip them if you have enough understanding the map.
        </p>

        <h3>My expirience</h3>
        <p>I played silksong on release day after struggling to purchase it due to it crashing
        all major game stores. It took me about about 50 hours to complete the game for the first time,
        that entire time i kept asking myself "How is there still more stuff i havent found!". Like the
        original game Hollow knight, I can see myself replaying this game over and over again.

        <h3>What is Limbus Company</h3>
        <p>Limbus company is a korean turn based rpg developed by Project Moon released on febuary 23rd 2023.
        you play as Dante, the manager of the Limbus Company Bus team (LCB). All that Dante knows is that
        they replaced their head with a scientifically magical clock. You are tasked by the company to
        retrieve the "golden boughs", reality warping branches that can resonate with one's mind, using the
        strength of the 12 sinners who you manage.</p>

        <h3>Why is it here?</h3>
        <p>Limbus compnay is here because I fell in love with its story and charcaters. each canto (chapter)
        primarily focuses on one of the sinners; exploring their past, motivations and regrets as they come
        face to face with the people / places they once knew. I also really enjoy the setting, that being "the city".
        The city is split up into 25 districts each owned by a mega-corporation, the city is surrounded by a wasteland
        known as the outskirts. The whole city is under the control of "the head" which enforces the city laws.
        </p>

        <h3>My expirience</h3>
        <p>I got into limbus company due to being a fan of the project moon series. I had played the previous 2 games
        lobotomy corporation and libary of ruina. i have been playing since the game released and continue to play each
        update which introduces new units, story chpaters etc. Canto 8 - "The Surrendered Witnessing" was the last major 
        chapter to be released and I really enjoyed it due to its wide range of characters and the worldbuilding which
        for me, creates a sense of fear and excitment for what will happen in Canto 9.
