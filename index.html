            <img src="/images/silksong.webp">

            <h3>What is this game?</h3>
            <p>Silksong is a metroidvania developed by an austrian team of 3 called
            Team Cherry. You play as hornet who has been taken from her own land to
            the kingdom of Pharloom, a land haunted by silk and song. Her goal is
            to find out why she was brought to Pharloom by ascending to the shining
            citadel at the kingdoms peak.</p>

            <h3>Why do i like it so much?</h3>
            <p>I love this game because of how openly it is designed. In silksong
            by paying attention to your surrondings and understanding your own
            skillset you can completely break the "intended order" of progression.
            also i really enjoy the lore of Pharloom and how you will slowly come
            to learn about how Pharloom began to decline after uprisings and
            betrayals.</p>

            <h2 id="limbuscompanybookmark">Limbus Company</h2>
            <img src="/images/limbuscompany.webp">

            <h3>What is this game?</h3>
            <p>Limbus company is a Korean RPG developed by Project Moon. you play
            as dante, an amnesiac with a clock for a head. you manage 12 "sinners"
            on a misson to collect the golden boughs. Each chapter focuses on a
            diffrent sinner and how the confront their past. the game is set in "the
            city" which is controlled by megacorporations and "the head".
            </p>

            <h3>Why do i like it so much?</h3>
            <p>I love this game for how its able to tackle the variety of issues
            that the sinners have. It tells amazing stories about war, grief,
            betrayal, love and life. despite the game featuring many supernatural
            elements it manages to keep its stories grounded in a way that allows
            us to connect to the sinners pain.</p>

            </p>

            <h3>Why do i like it so much?</h3>
            <p>I get so much joy at watching the Miis do crazy things like multiple
            people confessing their love for someone or performing a song together.
            My sister managed to get our dad get married to a youtuber she liked,
            the stories that you can discover playing this game always leaves me
            laughing.
